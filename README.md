# SSZB - Save the soul of Zlaya babka(evil old lady)

Yet another annoying club have been openned in the neighborhood. 
Nowdays these assholes will be raging in the club, making some lust.
Definitely I'll stop it throwing away from window flower pots, tv-sets, pianos on their redneck heads. Finally I'll buy this club and rebuild it as garden-shop.

In day mode you can buy "weapon", in night mode you fight with enemies.
